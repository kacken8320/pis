School
======

School is centralized and controlled by the state. It is focused on efficiency and collectiveness. Societal education is seen as equally important as academical education. The contents are country-wide uniform. Short-lived subjects don't exist to ensure quality. This is because short-lived subjects rarely have qualified teachers in this area, thus the education in these is worse.

Grading
-------

All schools, primary, secondary and tertiary, use the following for assessment scores and marks. They consist of a score from 0 to 100. 100 being the maximum achieveable score and 0 being the lowest. Results below 50 are considered not passed.

- **100-90**, "Exemplary" or "Excellent"
- **89-80**, "Very good"
- **79-70**, "Good"
- **69-60**, "Average"
- **59-50**, "Acceptable"
- **49-0**, "Unacceptable" or "Failed"

Lunch
-----

The lunch is prepared by professional nutritionists and cooks. They only use unprocessed foods. No sugar is used, except for naturally occurring sugars in unprocessed foods. For drinks, they only serve water and tea.

Students are assigned shifts of lunch duty (they are called *"staff"*). During the lunch break, they put on clean white aprons and hats, and retrieve the food from the kitchen. All kitchen personnel stand in a row during handover. The staff, also in a row, pass by each kitchen member, make eye contact, shake hands with their right hand, and say, *"Thank you for the food and your efforts."* The kitchen personnel respond, *"My pleasure, enjoy your meal."* The staff bring the food to the cafeteria, where they will serve it. They prepare the food on trays and hand it to the students with both hands. While making eye contact, the student says, *"Thank you for the food and your efforts."* The staff answer, *"My pleasure, enjoy your meal."* Students serve themselves water or tea, as they might want to refill. When every student is served, the staff serve each other following the same procedure and eat. They have slightly less time to eat that day due to pre- and post-paration.

Reinigung
---------

Students clean the school every day for 30 minutes: Class rooms, yard, floors, cafeteria, gymnasium, baths (without chemical products). The baths are additionally sanitized by professionals. Students organize the sanitation themselves, and are being supervised by the teachers (both cleanliness and organization). The practice is called *Reinigung*, as the term denotes both hygienic and symbolic functions.

Uniform
-------

School uniforms are worn throughout primary and secondary education. Their function includes promoting equality and social cohesion, supporting a sense of community, and enhancing safety on school grounds through easier identification of unauthorized individuals. Uniforms further contribute to discipline, student identification, and the development of affiliation with the school.

The uniforms are produced by the state. They contain no plastics and are made exclusively from natural materials, with the exception of sports apparel. Students receive a new set of uniforms each year. The uniforms are financed through taxation and are therefore provided passively, resulting in lower contributions from low-income households. Students are allowed to wear their uniforms in whatever combination they want.

A set includes:

- Dress shirt (10), short-arm dress shirt (10)
- Pants (10), short pants (10)
- Socks (20)
